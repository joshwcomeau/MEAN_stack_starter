###To customize...

After you've cloned or forked this repo, you'll need to change the following stuff to match your project:

* Package.json and bower.json with the new app name/description.
* Config/db.js with proper DB name and credentials
* Server-side routes in app/routes.js
* Client-side routes in public/app.routes.js
* Model names: Change everything you need to in app/models/ and public/components/
